## UseCases

With the ability to analyze current fashion trends and incorporate user feedback, our solution will inspire confidence in shoppers' fashion choices while saving them time and decision fatigue.

* Personalization
Our AI analyzes past purchases, browsing, and preferences to create personalized outfit suggestions matching individual taste.

* Friendly Interface
offers a friendly chatbot that interacts naturally, providing outfit suggestions through text, resembling a fashion consultation.

* Special Occasion Styling
For special events like weddings, parties, or festivals, users can engage in a conversation to get outfit recommendations that match the occasion's theme, regional trends, and personal style.

* Trendy Outfit Ideas
Stay updated with the latest fashion trends by conversing with the AI, which combines insights from social media trends with your individual preferences to suggest on-trend outfits.

## Approach

* **Dialogue management module** :- Employs an LLM to engage in conversations with users, maintain contextual understanding, and perform system actions like initiating requests to a recommendation engine. This unifies the entire process as a language modeling task.

* **Recommendation engine** :- A comprehensive conceptual framework is outlined for conducting retrieval using an LLM across an extensive item database. Different strategies are used to meet specific needs based on the data at hand.

* **User profiles and fashion trends** :- Integration of  user profiles, along with real-time fashion trends, as supplementary inputs to system LLMs. This enriches session-level context and enhances the personalized experience.

* **Ranker Module** :- The ranker module leverages an LLM to correlate preferences inferred from user profiles, fashion trends, and ongoing conversations with item details we retrieved previously. This results in a personalized set of recommendations displayed to the user. Additionally, the LLM generates explanations for its decisions, enhancing transparency.

## TechStack

* **OpenAI API**
* **LangChain**
* **Chainlit**
* **Redis**
